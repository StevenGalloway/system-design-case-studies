# Architecture Principles

1. Playback is the primary availability objective.
2. Design for failure at every layer.
3. Avoid single points of failure and control.
4. Prefer stateless, horizontally scalable services.
5. Contain blast radius using cells and isolation boundaries.
6. Every service must publish SLOs.
7. Automate recovery before humans intervene.
8. Measure real user experience continuously.
9. Ship small, reversible changes.
10. Optimize for long-term operational simplicity.
